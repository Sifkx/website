  <h2>Beginners Tutorial</h2> 
  <p>Beginners tutorials are for people who have never played chess before,or who may have played but are unclear on one or more rules of the game.These tutorials assume no prior knowledge of the game.</p> 
  <h1>Introduction to Chess.</h1> 
  <h2>The Game of Chess</h2> 
  <p>Chess is a game of strategy and tactics for two players,played on 8Ã—8 chequered board.Although chess sets come in many varieties and colours,the traditional colours are white and black,and that is how we will be referring to the two players on this website.The aim of the game is to trap your opponent's king,which is called <strong>Checkmate</strong>.A game can also be won if your opponent gives up (in chess we call it <em>resigning</em>),and there are varity of ways a game can end in a draw,in which case neither player wins.We will look at these in more detail later on.</p> 
  <h2>The Chess pieces</h2> 
  <p>Each player has an army consisting of a king,a queen,two rooks,two bishops,two knight,and eight pawns.</p>

  <p>A chessboard is a kind of checkerboard and consists of 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns)and 32 chess pieces.These squares are arranged in two alternative colours (light and dark)as I have mentioned above. </p>
  <h2>Get started with the simple steps:</h2> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Set the board and make sure that the bottom right square is a white square.If your board has algebric notations on it make sure '1' is nearest to white and '8'is nearest to black.The 'a' letter should be on a white left.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <br> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Place the <strong>rook/castle</strong> on each of the two corners.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>Place the <strong>knights</strong> beside the <strong>rooks/castle</strong>.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>Now set your <strong>bishops</strong> to the inside of the knights.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>Then place your <strong>queens</strong> on the matching color square.Queen is a second most important piece in chess after the king.But always sits in the color of its square.So the light coloured square will have white queen and the black queen has to be placed on a dark square of the board that is on the left side of the board where both queens are placed.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>Now place your <strong>king</strong> on the last square left.King side of the board is the right side of the board,where both kings are placed.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li>Place all the <strong>pawns</strong> on the front squares,so that they can declare the war.</li> 
   <h2>Chess pieces and their points</h2> 
   <p>All chess pieces have different points to indicate how valuable they are and if you want to play for chess tournaments,it is also important to learn the points that each chess piece is worth of and the points of possible combinations.Let's have a look:</p> 
   <li><strong>The King</strong> = Invaluable</li> 
   <li><strong>The Queen</strong> = 9 points</li> 
   <li><strong>The Rook</strong> = 5 points</li> 
   <li><strong>The Bishop</strong> = 3 points</li> 
   <li><strong>The Knight</strong> = 3 points</li> 
   <li><strong>The Pawn</strong> = 1 points</li> 
   <h2>Combinations</h2> 
   <li><strong>Rook + Knight</strong> = 7.5 points</li> 
   <li><strong>Rook + Bishop</strong> = 8 points</li> 
   <li><strong>Rook + Rook</strong> = 10 points</li> 
   <p>The person with the white side pieces always start the game.The game is all about saving the king (as I have mentioned above) so,the king carries infinite value.The interesting rule of the game is the king can never be captured and if he is in danger he must move to a safe place or another chess piece must make him safe.If he cannot reach in the safe zone then the game is over.</p> 
   <h2>How the Chess pieces move</h2> 
   <li><strong>Pawns</strong> - A pawn can usually move one square forward from the intial position,the pawn can even move two squares forward if desired.If a pawn wants to take another piece,it has to move one square diagonally.Pawns as a loyal foot soldiers,are only allowed to go forward,but never backward.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li><strong>Rooks</strong> - The Rook is allowed to move along one whole file vertically and horizontally and can take any piece which is on its way.It's as valuable as 5 pawns.</li> 
   <br> 
   <li><strong>Knights</strong> - The horse shaped knight is the only chess piece which can jump over other pieces.The knight moves in an L shape from any square on the board.Imagine an L shape made from any 3 connected squares</li>
